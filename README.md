# Why am I on Github? 

**The tldr version!**

With the shifting landscape due to AI, I'm starting to see the benefits of diversifying myself into frontend and eventually backend. The aim is to be a bit better than a vibe-coder and actualy understand the foundations of programming.

**The bigger version** 

Over the years, I’ve found myself working across product, design, motion graphics, writing, and storytelling. I think it came from my instinct to solve whatever problem was in front of me, partly because I was genuinely curious, and mostly because I was young enough to keep asking for more work (and not wise enough to stop). I’ve worked as a designer, animator, writer, filmmaker - heck, even as a mentor to about 40-odd new joinees at one point. And for a long time, I wasn’t sure how all these pieces fit together, or if they ever would.

But now, with the shifting landscape due to AI, I’m starting to see that the future might make more sense for people like me, generalists who know how to move fast, think across disciplines, and use the right mix of tools and judgment to build what’s needed. 

Lately, I’ve started front-end development - not just to code for the sake of it, but to understand what’s feasible, what’s worth the time, and how to design better. Now, when I design in Figma, I already have a sense of which components will scale well and which ones might make life harder for developers without much payoff. It’s helped me cut down unnecessary complexity and stay focused on what really matters.

I used to wonder if being a generalist would hold me back. Now I see it’s the reason I can stay relevant. I can go from concept to design, to motion, to front-end - and I understand how each decision shapes the product and the story it tells.
